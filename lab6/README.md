# graphics.h

* You will need to setup `graphics.h` library to be able to use this code.

* Follow this [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEkAj-xVTKQ) to setup `graphics.h` on codeblocks

* Personal Opinion, don't try to set it up on vs code too mush hustle.

# Compiling

* If some reason you are compiling this manually write this line 
    ```
    g++ main.cpp -I ./headers/
    ```
    This is to add the headers path to g++ compiler
